CAL-Advanced-Workshop
Prototyping Whatsapp in 8 Hours
=====================

In this workshop, we will develop a Whatsapp-like app called CAL Messenger. PHP, MYSQL, Android and Goolge Cloud Messaging (GCM) are used.

This workshop is splitted into 2 4-hour lessons. The first lesson will focus on the server setup and programming and the second lesson will focus on the Android client.

This is only a prototype, we would we can inspire more students to enjoy mobile apps development.

P.S If you use other 3rd party service, e.g. Google Cloud Platforms, will be even able to prototype in 4 hours :)
